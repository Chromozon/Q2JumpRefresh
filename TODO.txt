- Remove the forceteam command
- Make it so an invalid command isn't printed to chat?  Maybe make a toggle for this.
- There is this "tourney" mode which seems to be unused.
- The function "SelectSpawnPoint" can be cleaned up.  Currently it looks for the red/blue team spawn points, then deathmatch, then info_play_start.
- The "apply_time" function has a funky way of determining first place; could use cleanup overall.
- The kill and recall functions share some logic and have CTF overtime logic cluttering them up.

- There are a bunch of variables that have to deal with map completion time, but many seem unused:
	float			item_timer; // map completion time
	float			item_timer_penalty;
	int			item_timer_penalty_delay;
	float			stored_item_timer;
	qboolean	item_timer_allow;
